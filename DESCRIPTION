Description: Anticlustering partitions a pool of elements into
    subsets (i.e., anticlusters) in such a way that the subsets are as
    similar as possible. This is accomplished by maximizing instead of
    minimizing a clustering objective function, such as the intra-cluster
    variance (used in k-means clustering) or the sum of pairwise distances
    within clusters. Thus, anticlustering creates similar sets of elements
    by maximizing heterogeneity within anticlusters. This package
    implements exact and heuristic anticlustering algorithms as described
    in Papenberg and Klau (2019; <doi:10.31234/osf.io/3razc>). The exact
    approach requires that the GNU linear programming kit
    (https://www.gnu.org/software/glpk/glpk.html) and the R package
    `Rglpk` (https://cran.R-project.org/package=Rglpk) are installed.
    Also includes methods for classical clustering problems under size
    constraints (i.e., creating equal-sized clusters), as well as methods
    for (unrestricted or K-partite) matching.
